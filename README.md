<p> is a simple android application for organizing training time. </p>
  
## About
With the app you can customize a training in any way you want. You need to do it just once without any control of time and changing timer every time you change the length of an exercise. One simple customization of the training and you forget about time after clicking one button!
  
10 tabatas with 1 min rest between them? OK, you can choose 10 rounds with 4 exercises of 20 s, rest between exercises of 10 s and rest between rounds of 1 min.
  
Maybe 4 rounds with 6 exercises, where each one lasts 50 s and rests between them last 10 s? You can do so.
  
You can even have different timing in different rounds. For example you can start with 3 rounds of 6 exercises of 45 s with the rests between them of 15 s, and finish with 2 tabatas. You can also customise rests between rounds (for example if you want the first rests to be equal 30 s and the following 1 min).
  
One customization solves all time problems.
  
## Features
You can customize a training according to the next points:
- Number of rounds in a training
- Whether rounds are equal (regarding the number of exercises and their timing)
- Whether rests between rounds are equal
- Number of exercises in a certain round
- Time of one exercise
- Time of one rest between exercises
- Time of rests between rounds
